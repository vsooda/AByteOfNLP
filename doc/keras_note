1. keras layer inherent is: object -> layer -> maskedLayer -> recurrent -> lstm, gru and so on

2. Layer define two function mainly: get_output, get_input. get_output define how to caculate in this layer. get_input define where the data come from. in general, the input data come from last layer. The class Seqential combine all layer in a list. so we can find the last layer.

3. maskedLayer offer two function: get_input_mask, get_output_mask. the class extend maskedLayer will deal with the padd zero. but the mask is the input mask in general. if want the mask about the output, need to define a new class.

4. model.compile do some initial work. the loss caculate with weights which will take all zero into accounts. so it is the method to deal with not equal length output??

5. in model class, it will also define optimizer and _fit will call _train to train the model with compile params.
